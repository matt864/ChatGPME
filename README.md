A quiz to test the effectiveness of LLMs to mimic my tone of voice. Simply guess from two options which you think I wrote.

This is v1 of multi-stage test to see which kinds of prompts and techniques lead to greater mimicry of writing style.


1 - I came up with 10 prompts based on recent tech articles and industry events.
2 - I answered these prompts myself first, so I wasn't swayed by whatever the AI wrote. I kept all answers under 300 characters
3 - I then gave Bard a relevant article that I wrote and asked it to mimic the author of the article (me) whilst answering the same question.
4 - I recorded the outputs and randomly ordered them in this quiz!
