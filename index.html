  Welcome! This project is designed to test how well a LLM can mimic me and whether it can trick you into thinking I wrote something. Here are the steps I took to make this project happen to ensure methodological soundness.
  <ol>
    <li>I came up with 10 prompts based on recent tech articles and industry events.</li>
    <li>I answered these prompts myself first, so I wasn't swayed by whatever the AI wrote. I kept all answers under 300 characters</li>
    <li>I then gave Bard a relevant article that I wrote and asked it to mimic the author of the article (me) whilst answering the same question.</li>
    <li>I recorded the outputs and randomly ordered them in this quiz!</li>
  </ol>
  You will be shown 10 prompts, with both mine and the LLMs response next to each other, in a randomised order. It's your job to guess correctly by <span class="llm-answer">clicking the answer you think I wrote.</span><br><br>
  This is version 1 of the test. Score out of 10 will be measured. All prompts and responses are listed in the <a href="https://github.com/matt864/ChatGPME">GitHub repo</a>, and I will repeat the test with different prompts, with the end goal of increasing the failure rate of people to distinguish my writing from the AIs.

    question: "What is your favourite programming language?",
    answers: ["My fav. lang. is JavaScript. Versatile, powerful, easy to learn, and always in demand. It's a bit messy, but that's part of its charm. Try it out!", "I learnt JavaScript and then pretty much stopped there and fell into the void of packages and libraries and Node.js."],

  },
  {
    question: "Who is going to win the AI war?",
    answers: ["The AI war is anyone's game. The big tech giants have a head start, but startups and smaller companies are innovating fast. The winners will be the companies that can build the best AI models and user experiences.", "Microsoft are positioning themselves really well with their investment into OpenAI, but it's hard to tell at the pace the industry is moving. Ultimately whoever solves direct problems with their tech and avoids regulatory backlash will probably have the most success."],
    answer : 1
  },
  {
    question: "Who is your favourite tech entrepreneur?",
    answers: ["I would answer Grace Hopper here although she wasn't really an entrepreneur so I will say Steve Wozniak is probably my favourite, I love how he never lost any of his enthusiasm for technology, stayed humble despite insane success and absolutely biffed it on Dancing with the Stars.", "My favorite tech entrepreneur is Shigeru Miyamoto. He is a true innovator who has changed the way we interact with and enjoy technology. His games are not just about high scores or competition; they are about fun and creativity. He has created some of the most beloved and enduring franchises in gaming history, and his work has inspired generations of developers and players."],

  {
    question: "What stock are you betting on right now and why?",
    answers: ["I'm betting on New Loxley University. The cost of university is too high, and the creator economy is making it less appealing. New Loxley is a new company that offers online education with slick UIs and cool alumni packages. I think it has the potential to be a major player in the future of education.", "Super easy to say after their stock skyrocketed, but Nvidia have shown a willingness to pivot and have positioned themselves to be a dominant force in the AI hardware game."],
    answer :1,
  }
  ,
  {
    question: "What is the biggest workplace advancement coming in the next twenty years?",
    answers: ["AI will revolutionize the workplace by automating tasks, personalizing experiences, and increasing productivity. But we must be aware of its potential downsides, like job displacement and bias.", "The 4 day work week is going to happen, and then you can bet your bottom dollar (or pound) that we are going to complain about 4 days of work. Also I think AI is going to be like Microsoft Office, just absolutely everywhere and we will all have to teach our 64 year old coworkers how to use it."],

  {
    question: "Why did you build your website?",
    answers: ["I was incredibly bored. I also just love building things from scratch, starting with an empty folder on my computer and typing like I'm trying to murder imaginary ants until there is something to show for it.", "I built my website because I love tech and want to share it with others in a fun, casual way. I don't care about success, just making people laugh."],
    answer :0,
  },
  {
    question: "Why do you like technology?",
    answers: ["The hacky answer is that it accelerates the progress of humanity. The real answer is I loved Star Wars as a kid and I see it as a way to get my hands on a lightsaber.", "I like technology because it's constantly changing and evolving. It's like a giant puzzle that I'm always trying to solve. And the best part is that I can share my passion for technology with others through my writing. I don't care about being the best tech blogger or making a ton of money. I just want to help people understand the world around them and have a good time doing it."],

  {
    question: "What are your opinions on the metaverse?",
    answers: ["The metaverse is a buzzword-filled pipe dream. I'm more interested in seeing real tech that improves our lives.", "I think the vision is awesome, and from trying VR I absolutely loved it. However, I don't think people want to live there, the vision needs to be slightly smaller and primarily focused on gaming and communication, rather than commercialisation/all entertainment/financial."],

  {
    question: "How can technology help the world?",

It's up to us to use it for good."],
